# Data folder readme

This folder contains datasets used in the Hayes and Buma 2020 manuscript. Raw datasets are marked with "_raw.csv". 

- "Steese_DBH_raw.csv" and "Dalton_DBH_raw.csv" contain overstory data of each respective site, and combine to create "dbh_raw.csv". 
- "site_attrib.csv" contains values of slope, elevation, solar radiation, longitude and latitude for each plot (calculated using DEM files in ArcGIS - files not included here).
